This repository is a compilation of all Machine Learning models I have built.

STELLAR CLASSIFICATION: 
This model aims to classify stars in space as red giants or dwarf starts, based on data such as their diameter, brightness, etc. The data itself, was obtained from kaggle.com. The model trained is a Logistic regression model. The achieved accuracy is 87.5%.

Covid-19 Mortality prediction:
This project contains both a decision tree and a random forest model.  The mortality of the patient is decided by a number of factors such as age, previous afflictions, the medications the patient is currently taking, history of lung disease, etc. 
First, the unwanted attributes were identified and dropped. Then the data was visualized with the help of plots and graphs to understand the correlation between attributes. Once the necessary attributes were identified, the data was trained on both the decision tree and random forest models. The decision tree achieved a score of 93.5%, while the random forest achieved a score of 93.9%
